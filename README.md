**TITLE:**

Validate the ns-3 implementation of TCP Low Priority in DCE

This Validating-the-TCP-LP-implementation-in-ns-3 repository is a joint Computer Networks project.

**Description**

TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP) is a Less than Best Effort TCP. This category of TCPs are used to ensure
that bandwidth hungry large flows do not saturate the bandwidth and starve small delay sensitive flows.
In this project, the aim is to validate ns-3 TCP-LP implementation by comparing the results obtained from 
it to those obtained by simulating Linux TCP-LP.  

**Required Experience**

- C and C++

**References**

- Direct Code Execution (Link: https://www.nsnam.org/overview/projects/direct-co- xecution/​) 
- Linux kernel code (Link: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.4/source/net/ipv4/tcp_hybla.c​)
- ns-3 code for TCP Hybla (Path: ns-3.xx/src/internet/model/tcp-hybla.{h, cc})
